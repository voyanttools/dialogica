## Welcome to Dialogica: Thinking-Through Voyant!
*Dialogica: Thinking-Through Voyant* (DTTV) is a textbook for learning computer-assisted text analysis with [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org) and [Spyral](https://voyant-tools.org/spyral/). It complements our book [Hermeneutica: Computer-Assisted Interpretation in the Humanities](http://hermeneuti.ca) (MIT Press, 2016). 

*Dialogica* was developed by Geoffrey Rockwell and Stéfan Sinclair in early 2020 to help those pivoting to online learning. We continue to add to it in [memory of Stéfan](https://csdh-schn.org/stefan-sinclair-in-memoriam-2/) who passed away in August, 2020.

Do you need online teaching ideas and materials? Dialogica was supposed to be a text book, but instead we are adapting it for use in online learning and self-study. It is shared here under a CC BY 4.0 license so you can adapt as needed.

Do you have a tutorial for Voyant you would like to adapt to *Dialogica*? Would you like to contribute? Send links and thoughts to Geoffrey Rockwell (grockwel at ualberta dot ca).
